## API Description



The GlobalWineScore API is designed as a RESTful API, providing several resources and methods depending on your usage plan.

For further information please refer to <a href="https://www.globalwinescore.com/plans" target="_blank">our plans</a>.

# Authentication
The API uses token-based authentication.
In order to authenticate your requests, you need to include a specific header in each of your requests:

```
Authorization: Token {YOUR-API-TOKEN}
```

If you don't have a token yet, you need to apply for one [here](https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/) or drop us an email at <a href="mailto:api@globalwinescore.com">api@globalwinescore.com</a>

Your personal token can be found under the <a href="https://www.globalwinescore.com/account/api/" target="_blank">My account > API</a> section of the GlobalWineScore website

# Format
The API provides several rendering formats which you can control using the `Accept` header or `format` query parameter.

- JSON (default): no header or `Accept: application/json`
- XML: `Accept: application/xml`

# Error handling

Whether a request succeeded is indicated by the HTTP status code. A 2xx status code indicates success, whereas a 4xx status code indicates failure.

When a request fails, the response body is still JSON, but always contains a `detail` field with a description of the error, which you can inspect for debugging.

For example, trying to access the API without proper authentication will return code 403 along with the message:

`{"detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."}`

# Ordering

At the moment, GlobalWineScores may be sorted by `date` and `score`. Use "-"
to sort in descending order.

# Continuous synchronization

If you need to synchronize your database with our API, you can query our API using `?ordering=-date` to get the newest scores first, which means you won't have to crawl the whole catalog every time :-)

# Quick search interface
If you need to search our catalog (e.g. to align it with yours), we're providing you with a handy interface accessible here: <a href="https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/" target="_blank">https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/</a>

You need to be logged in (email/password) to access this page, but other than that you can share it with anyone in your team and start searching right away !
